# ðŸ§ª The Lab
Home to workshops & lighting talks at Outernet!

Imagine a place where you can learn something new, and come out with something of your own? Something techinal or nerdy like your own programming lanuage, or your very own canvas of art, there's no limit to what a workshop or lighting talk can be (as long as it's legal :p), the only limit is your imagnation.

The Lab isn't like your typical hackathon or event workshop, it's a space for you to learn, host, or create a exprince. At the end of the day, we want it to be **open to you!**. This means that we're not going to have a typical schedule, or requirements. We're not handpicking workshop or talks (to an extent) and only having those, we're working with every idea and polish it until it's perfect. We'll have some slots open where anyone can sign up during the event, we'll keep the space open (even in off-hours), and try to help you get what you need.

This is the Lab.

# Sumbit your Idea!

You've sumbitted your idea for a **Workshop and/or Lighting Talk** when you signed up and now you want to get your workshop or lighting talk (or both) at outernet.
Instead of reviewing workshops oursleves based on your prompts, we've decided to make it more open and for the community.

Here's how!

1. If you sumbitted an idea, you should have gotten a email to a template that has your workshop prompt set, along with your name, and github username

   2. Use the guiding questions in the template (or make your own âœ¨), and add more information about your workshop
   3. Mention some examples of what the exprince will be like, and if you might need something
  
   We're not expecting you to be _**Really Detailed **_ here, just a rough sketch of what you want your workshop and/or lighting talk to be like.

   4. After you've got everything done, sumbit a PR (Instructions are in the email and template!), and post in #outernet-lab-tbd with your PR and workshop name!
  
   5. Someone will then review your workshop and provide suggestions, and let the community vote (to an extent, there will still be manual review from the workshops team)
  
   6.
